[Insert the entire competency framework JSON here]
Now, for the given role:

Organization: [organization]
Role Title: [role_title]
Department: [department] (if provided)

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

Only select competencies that are DIRECTLY and SPECIFICALLY relevant to this exact role within this particular organization
Consider the organization's industry, size, culture, and business context when determining relevance
Avoid generic competency selections that could apply to any role - focus on what makes THIS role unique in THIS organization
Do not include competencies that are merely "nice to have" - only include those that are essential or highly important
If a competency theme has multiple sub-themes, only include the sub-themes that are specifically relevant (not all sub-themes automatically)
Your confidence level should reflect both the importance of the competency AND how certain you are about its relevance to this specific organizational context

For each selected competency, provide:

The category (Behavioural, Functional, Domain)
The competency theme name
Only the relevant competency sub-themes (be selective)
A confidence level (as a percentage, e.g., 85) indicating how certain you are that this competency is critically important for this specific role in this specific organization

Additionally, provide a brief rationale explaining why you selected these specific competencies for this role within this organization, demonstrating clear understanding of the organizational and role context.
